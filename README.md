# AuroraReact
Site for dislaying chance of viewing aurora borealis. 
I went to school in the upper peninsula of Michigan, which meant that I had a good shot at catching a glimpse of the Northern Lights. However, I found that figuring out how likely it was I would be able to view the lights was a bit of a chore. So, I made it a little bit easier by scraping NOAA data, cloud coverage, and making a simple visual. 

Made possible with: 
 * [Darksky API](https://darksky.net/dev) for cloud coverage data
 * [NOAA](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast) for aurora data
 * [Ian Forrest](https://www.gradient-animator.com/) for gradient animation
 
 Background aurora animation opacity scales with percentage chance of visibilty.
